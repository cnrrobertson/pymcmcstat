Changelog
=========

v1.9.1 (October 24, 2020)
---------
- Fixed #79 - Chainstats display now auto updates formatting for really large or small numbers.
- Fixed #82 - Initial value check routine in Parallel MCMC now correctly removes extra columns.

v1.9.0 (July 19, 2019)
---------

   :target: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3342988

- Added feature to results structure to store all parameters names, regardless of whether or not they are included in sampling.
- Added mcmcplot package to requirements.  MCMCPlotting module is noted as deprecated.
- Added new module for uncertainty propagation.  Aims to provide more flexible API for user to plot different combinations of credible and prediction intervals.
- Added a plotting routine so that you can plot a 2-D interval in 3-D space.

v1.8.0 (June 28, 2019)
----------------------
.. image:: https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3261287.svg
   :target: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3261287

- Added acceptance rate display feature when calling chain statistics
- User can specify `skip` or `maxpoints` in pairwise correlation and chain panel plots in order to thin chain.
- User can request item definitions when calling `chainstats`.
- Resolved #51 by adding method to check if limits are incompatible.  User is provided with more descriptive error message.
- Updated documentation for Bayesian components.
- Added saving routines to accomodate post-processing.  A lighter version of the results dictionary is saved to json when log routines are used for chains.  This should address #55.
- Option to return KDE objects when using `plot_density_panel`.  User can then evaluate pdf directly.  This should address #66.

v1.7.1 (May 3, 2019)
---------------------
.. image:: https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.2660145.svg
   :target: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2660145
   
- Fixed bug #41.
- Updated how version attribute is defined in package and referenced in setup.py and documentation.

v1.7.0 (April 5, 2019)
----------------------
.. image:: https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.2630882.svg
      :target: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2630882

- Added custom sampler feature.  Interface requires creation of a class, but allows for inclusion of things like Gibbs samplers.  User can explicitly pass in features to the sum-of-squares function.
- Added check routines for reading in parallel MCMC results to ensure only directories with name 'chain_' are queried.
- All files were updated to comply with formatting standards using *flake8*.
- Added coverage report check to ensure minimal testing requirements are met.
- Added original covariance matrix to results structure for reference.

v1.6.0 (August 31, 2018)
------------------------
.. image:: https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1407136.svg
   :target: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1407136

- Added optimal handling of prior function used numpy array multiplication.
- Fixed bug with saving results to json file - output directory now automatically made.
- Updated PI plotting to allow any valid matplotlib input.
- Added Gelman-Rubin diagnostics to ChainStatistics module, with display feature.
- Added numpy error settings option to MCMC initialization.
- Setup no adaptation feature.  Can sample parameters without adapting them.
- Added restart routine to ParallelMCMC.  Can restart from json files.
- Added parallel chain organization routines to the chain subpackage.

v1.5.0 (July 27, 2018)
----------------------
.. image:: https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1322773.svg
   :target: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1322773
- Final release of 1.5.0.
- First release with complete test coverage.
- Updated analysis options and diagnostics.
- Improved workflow on remote OS.
- Added link to Zenodo DOI.

v1.4.0 (July 11, 2018)
----------------------
- Added extensive unit tests.

v1.3.1 (April 20, 2018)
-----------------------
- Fixed sample feature (allows for fixed variables).
- automatic naming (and expansion) for plot labels.
- added covariance matrix to log file output.

v1.3.0 (April 3, 2018)
----------------------
- All features updated to work with Python 3.6
- This was the last version developed using Python 2.7.  It may still work on Python 2.7, but it will not be included as a part of testing.

v1.2.0 (April 3, 2018)
----------------------
- Added ellipse contour routine for pairwise plots.
- Added progress bar to prediction interval generation (as it can be time consuming).
- Added log file saving so you can periodically dump the latest set of samples to file.

v1.1.1 (February 26, 2018)
--------------------------
- Fixed bug associated with plotting credible intervals without prediction intervals.

v1.1.0 (February 19, 2018)
--------------------------
- Added feature for generating and plotting prediction/credible intervals.

v1.0.0 (February 15, 2018)
--------------------------
- First official release.
- Incorporated class structures into entire architecture.
